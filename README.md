# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

Run a JSON server as an API server for our project. It runs on PORT 3001 (http://localhost:3001)
This emulates an API server which stores data for the client application to interact with. The server responds with the client using the Popular REST based protocol. This projects demonstrates the typical CRUD operations which the client app performs with the API server.
